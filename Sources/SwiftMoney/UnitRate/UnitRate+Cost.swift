extension UnitRate {

    /// Computes the price for a given quantity at this unit rate.
    ///
    /// The calculation is:
    /// ```
    /// price = round(quantity × rate.numerator × minimalQuantisation / rate.denominator)
    /// ```
    /// performed in `Int128` with GCD pre-reduction to maximise the range of
    /// inputs that can be computed without overflow.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let oilPrice = UnitRate<USD, String>(Rate("14500/200")!, per: "barrel")
    /// let result = oilPrice.price(forQuantity: 1000)
    /// result.amount  // Money<USD>(minorUnits: 7_250_000) — $72,500.00
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - quantity: The number of units consumed. May be negative (e.g. export).
    ///   - rounding: The rounding rule for fractional minor units.
    ///     Defaults to `.toNearestOrAwayFromZero`.
    /// - Returns: A ``RateCalculation`` containing the rounded price and the
    ///   effective rate that was applied.
    /// - Precondition: The intermediate product must fit in `Int128` after
    ///   GCD reduction. Traps on overflow.
